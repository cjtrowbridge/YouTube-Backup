# YouTube-Backup
A simple script for backing up your favorite YouTube channels.

Create a file called channels.txt in the same directory as the update script, contianing a list of all the URLs for the channels you want to back up.

Run update.sh and it will back up all the channels in your list and organize them in folders by channel name, playlist name, and then order and title.
